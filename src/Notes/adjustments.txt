JUNE 3RD 2022

WORK FLOW :
Worked on grabbing cards for switching, 

1. Single card component has functionality for choosing a faceup card for switching. 
Also has a catch to see if two cards are in the hand and if so clears my cards to 
switch array. Need to build error throw for this however 

2.switching function lives in manageGame file called chooseSwitch.

TO - DO:
1. Need to build functionality for switching topCard and also choosing a card from deck
pile for switching COMPLETED

2. Actively switch a card from deck or topcard with card choosen in hand.  COMPLETED

JUNE 10TH 2022

WORK FLOW: 
Got swapping between deck and hand done. Scoring works with swaps. Had to switch only src and val
for players card because it would always render face down after swap. Something to look at later...

TO - DO:
1. Pop up to give user option to use card they just drawed.
   - have it be added to toSwap array or be thrown back on topcard pile.
   - clean easy to use design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JUNE 23RD 2022

WORK FLOW:
Deck pile selection working with functionality of discard and use working well.
May need to implement a better visual for user to know what card is selected. Thinking about
doing highlighted border when a card is selected in the hand and for the deck pile choice.
I am passing a lot of arguments into my components, be nice to come up with a solution to
clean that up but thats more for style purposes.

TO-DO : 
1. Starting a new round and keeping track of previous scores
   - roundResult component as a pop up that shows scores then gives user option to
     quit playing or play next round. 
   - Maybe do a score board on the right side of screen showing round scores and totals?

AUGUST 18TH 2023

Fixed card selecting bug in users hand. 

Need to add card highlighting when selected and put restrictions on selecting a card that is face down
when a user chooses to use a card in the deckpile also need to be able to unselect a card. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEPTEMBER 18th 2023

Highlighting working on selecting card from deck pile. Using useState Highlight in app and passing them
both the DeckPiles component and SingleCard comp. Changing their states to turn off highlighting. Need to
test it more and get it working properly.

Hoping after that to set restictions in which card you can grab and also allow someone to unselect a card. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEPTEMBER 20th 2023

Got the highlighting done for single card and deck piles. useEffect in single card renders 
anytime we trigger a change in deck pile on card flips.

Need to add error handling for wrong card moves and actions happening without restriction
which will make for buggy game mechanics. 

I don't think I have added any error checking for the deck piles ALSO need to think about
turning off highlighting when INVALID SWAP is performed. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEPTEMBER 28th 2023

added error checking with toast functions for invalid card swaps. They work well, but Rachel
made point about not allowing them to do invalid moves at all. Will probably come back to this
idea, I have just a few smaller game mechanic things to do.

Need to fix when a user selects a flipped card and then draws from top of deck, this does not
work currently. -DONE

Need to add error handling for grabbing top card then drawing a card from pile, this is allowed
and needs to be removed. -DONE

Need to fix when a person selects a card then draws from pile and discards this should be a loss
of turn, also need to unhighlight cards when this move is made.  - DONE

After this I want to work on adding multiple players and doing turns. Excited that I am making 
some good progress. Lots to do but very rewarding getting farther especially after taking a 
break from the project. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCTOBER 7th 2023

Fixed the game mechanics bugs I mentioned in my notes above. I beleive that game mechanics are 
completed... need to do ample testing of that and have some other people try to see if they find
mistakes.

The next steps are to create rounds and amount of turns as well. I want to also set up multiple 
players so you can choose how many players. Slowling getting there happy to have working 
mechanics and error handling!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JANUARY 17 2024

Working on building players queue for actual game play and round adding. Added index 
function and array of players. Notice that when updating a_hand when I click New Game 
the cards aren't automatically flipped over so the state is being changes as I make
moves to the hand. Need to fix this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JANUARY 18 2024

Got players array and display working. Fixed rendering issue mentione above as well.
I added a useEffect in app.js that updates the players array and keeps track of who is
up. Need to add a delay between player change, add turn over when card is flipped, logic
for selecting and then flipping. It is all coming together slowly I am stoked. 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JANUARY 23 2024

Added slight delay between flips of each player, need to end turn when user discards
from deck pile. ALSO need to add two card flip for each player in beginning of round...
Still more game mechanics to complete.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JANUARY 25 2024

Added discard to end turn, have calculated score after each player does their last turn,
need to add pause before PlayOn is set false to display the scores and to flip any cards not flipped.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEBRUARY 13 2024

Button now in RoundResult, need to make it trigger a function that preps current players
to get new hand of cards while keeping their scores intact. Also establish new deck and 
set all the the useState variables needed for proper gameplay... New Game function should
be very helpful for this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARCH 11 2024

Added a new function in App.js called nextRound which establishes a new round of cards and adds
previous rounds score to players. No check to see if round limit has been reached, will need to add this.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARCH 25 2024

Figured out how to decrease the gaps between cards. It was an issue with the grid-template-columns 
being set to auto/1fp making it want to fill whole web page specifically rather than sizing with px.
I will need to make the cards and deck pile smaller so it all fits on the screen nicer. I want to 
create a better nav bar as well for iniatiing a new game and using the title. I should touch these
items next.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARCH 26 2024

Made a navigation bar with a brown background. Looks decent for now. Ran into issue where View potential 
card pop up was not displaying the discard or use buttons. Spent an hour trying to debug. Had to add padding
to the buttons class in viewPopUp.js for them to have to be scrolled to see. A real pain but figured it out.
I want to make the player display next on the right side so people can see the other players hands.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARCH 27 2024

Added a new component called PlayerList that displays all the players on the right side of screen.
Currently is displays all players hands face up. I will need to add logic to only show the face up cards.
Super happy with the progress especially after yesterday's bug. The page currently is no responsive so that 
could be an issue. Will look at this further down the line.


TO-DOs :

 - Add round check to stop game if 9 OR 18 holes is reached.
 - Build display for end of game summary
