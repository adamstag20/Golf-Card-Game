WORK FLOW :
Worked on grabbing cards for switching, 

1. Single card component has functionality for choosing a faceup card for switching. 
Also has a catch to see if two cards are in the hand and if so clears my cards to 
switch array. Need to build error throw for this however 

2.switching function lives in manageGame file called chooseSwitch.

TO - DO:
1. Need to build functionality for switching topCard and also choosing a card from deck
pile for switching COMPLETED

2. Actively switch a card from deck or topcard with card choosen in hand.  COMPLETED

WORK FLOW: 
Got swapping between deck and hand done. Scoring works with swaps. Had to switch only src and val
for players card because it would always render face down after swap. Something to look at later...

TO - DO:
1. Pop up to give user option to use card they just drawed.
   - have it be added to toSwap array or be thrown back on topcard pile.
   - clean easy to use design
