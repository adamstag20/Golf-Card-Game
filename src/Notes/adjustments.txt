WORK FLOW :
Worked on grabbing cards for switching, 

1. Single card component has functionality for choosing a faceup card for switching. 
Also has a catch to see if two cards are in the hand and if so clears my cards to 
switch array. Need to build error throw for this however 

2.switching function lives in manageGame file called chooseSwitch.

TO - DO:
1. Need to build functionality for switching topCard and also choosing a card from deck
pile for switching

2. Actively switch a card from deck or topcard with card choosen in hand.
