WORK FLOW :
Worked on grabbing cards for switching, 

1. Single card component has functionality for choosing a faceup card for switching. 
Also has a catch to see if two cards are in the hand and if so clears my cards to 
switch array. Need to build error throw for this however 

2.switching function lives in manageGame file called chooseSwitch.

TO - DO:
1. Need to build functionality for switching topCard and also choosing a card from deck
pile for switching COMPLETED

2. Actively switch a card from deck or topcard with card choosen in hand.  COMPLETED

WORK FLOW: 
Got swapping between deck and hand done. Scoring works with swaps. Had to switch only src and val
for players card because it would always render face down after swap. Something to look at later...

TO - DO:
1. Pop up to give user option to use card they just drawed.
   - have it be added to toSwap array or be thrown back on topcard pile.
   - clean easy to use design

WORK FLOW:
Deck pile selection working with functionality of discard and use working well.
May need to implement a better visual for user to know what card is selected. Thinking about
doing highlighted border when a card is selected in the hand and for the deck pile choice.
I am passing a lot of arguments into my components, be nice to come up with a solution to
clean that up but thats more for style purposes.

TO-DO : 
1. Starting a new round and keeping track of previous scores
   - roundResult component as a pop up that shows scores then gives user option to
     quit playing or play next round. 
   - Maybe do a score board on the right side of screen showing round scores and totals?

Fixed card selecting bug in users hand. 

Need to add card highlighting when selected and put restrictions on selecting a card that is face down
when a user chooses to use a card in the deckpile also need to be able to unselect a card.

SEPTEMBER 18th 2023

Highlighting working on selecting card from deck pile. Using useState Highlight in app and passing them
both the DeckPiles component and SingleCard comp. Changing their states to turn off highlighting. Need to
test it more and get it working properly.

Hoping after that to set restictions in which card you can grab and also allow someone to unselect a card. 

SEPTEMBER 20th 2023

Got the highlighting done for single card and deck piles. useEffect in single card renders 
anytime we trigger a change in deck pile on card flips.

Need to add error handling for wrong card moves and actions happening without restriction
which will make for buggy game mechanics. 

I don't think I have added any error checking for the deck piles ALSO need to think about
turning off highlighting when INVALID SWAP is performed.
